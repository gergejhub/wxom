wxom mgmt brief v83

What changed
- scripts/update-data.mjs
  - Management brief generator now always includes base airports (from base.txt, IATA codes)
  - Brief uses trigger.label (no [object Object])
  - Adds plain-English summaries per airport (visibility/RVR/cloud base + plain weather words)
  - Adds base-airports status block + examples of impacted bases
  - Notable changes list uses airport name + IATA/ICAO (not ICAO-only)
  - schema_debug no longer flags minExplainMet/minExplainTaf as a string issue (expects object w/ tip)

What NOT to change
- assets/*, index.html: no UI changes required
- base.txt: keep as IATA codes, one per line (duplicates ok but unnecessary)
