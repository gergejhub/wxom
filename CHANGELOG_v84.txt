WXOM v84 – Management brief overhaul (English, management-friendly)

- management45 and detail90 rewritten to be meeting-readable.
- Base airports (base.txt) are always included.
- Triggers are converted to plain-English drivers (no raw tags in the brief).
- Lists no longer use "(+N more)" or ellipses; they use "and X others".
