CHANGELOG v85
- management45 rewritten for spoken, management-ready delivery (narrative sentences, fewer list-like separators).
- Base airports always included; lists capped with "and X others"; no "..." or "(+N more)".
- Fixed categorize() bug: "LIK...ELY" -> "LIKELY".
- Drivers/impact phrasing tuned for non-technical listeners.
