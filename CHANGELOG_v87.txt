v87 (Engine Ice Ops emphasis)
- Management brief: explicit sentence calling out ENG ICE OPS airports (base or non-base) near the top.
- Driver categorization: 'ENG ICE' now maps to 'engine anti-ice operations' (separate from generic icing risk).
- Driver pretty-mappings updated so the phrase reads cleanly in management45/detail90.
